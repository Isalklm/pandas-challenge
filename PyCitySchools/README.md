PyCitySchools Analysis 

Overview:

This project aims to analyze standardized test performance across schools in a city school district using Python's Pandas library.
The dataset includes information on student math and reading scores, school budgets, and other metrics. 
The analysis provides insights into school performance by various categories such as school size, school type (charter vs. district), 
spending per student, and grade-level performance.
The final report highlights several key trends, including the impact of school spending on performance, the performance difference between charter and district schools,
and grade-level analysis to determine where students are struggling the most. The conclusions drawn can help decision-makers allocate resources more effectively 
to improve overall school performance.
